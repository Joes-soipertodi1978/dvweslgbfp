Wow. Just stepped out of Inception, and my brain feels like it’s been through a blender on high speed. You know that feeling when you're spinning around too fast and suddenly stop? Yeah, that. Theater was crowded, dude next to me was literally a human-sized popcorn muncher and I swear he was louder than the soundtrack. Crumbs everywhere. My back’s killing me from those seats—like trying to nap in an origami crane.

Dreams inside dreams inside dreams... like some kind of Russian doll nightmare factory. When Cobb (DiCaprio looking all kinds of intense as usual) kept flipping between worlds, it was like trying to read a really gnarly choose-your-own-adventure novel, but on speed. Joseph Gordon-Levitt floating through hotel corridors as if physics got tired and went “nah,” not dealing with this today. Like, defying gravity — how? Why was my high school physics teacher so boring???

> Got this crazy sense that if I blinked I'd miss an intricately woven thread, like those rugs nana placed in the fancy room no one ever stepped into. Mal haunting Cobb’s mind was like when you can't shake a song out of your head, you know? But the song is terrifying and maybe trying to stab you. I guess that makes marriage a metaphor for... nightmares? God, that feels existential. Maybe life is an endless hallway full of masked dinners and betrayal... or maybe that was the guy in front of me slurping loudly, adding an echo to every gunfight.

Random, but do you remember who said I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Feels like the kind of 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a billion and one times to get all the layers, like a storytelling onion, but one that makes your eyes water for all kinds of new reasons. Feels like if I tried to explain the plot to anyone now, though, my brain might melt right out of my ears.

There's part of me that still thinks I'm in that theater. Like when Mal jumps off that ledge... dude, I swear I felt a chill in the AC. But then again, it was probably the air vent above me. Seriously, if I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again I'm bringing a blanket and aspirins.

# So is this how loops work??
dream = Is this a dream?
while dream == Is this a dream?:
    inception = True
    someone's_spinning_on_a_bloody_top()
    break

Alright, need water and maybe a nap. Or another trip back into someone's subconscious. Whichever comes first.
